```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
women_in_gov <- read_csv("data/women_in_gov.csv", skip = 4)
```

```{r}
women_in_gov <- clean_names(women_in_gov)
```

```{r}
unique(women_in_gov$x1990)
```
all values in the columns are the same, so removing the columns. Also removing all years from 1960-1989 for the same reason 
```{r}
women_in_gov_recent <- women_in_gov %>% 
  select(-(indicator_name:x1989))
```
