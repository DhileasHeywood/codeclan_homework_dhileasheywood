# GOAL: Model the average price of the avocados.
# SCENARIO: work for a company that sells avocados, and wants to maximise profit. They want me to make a model that shows the
# most important predictors of avocado price in the USA.

# Background information on the dataset, taken from the Kaggle page https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices):
#The table below represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data
#comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2013, the table
#below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following
#channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit
#(per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are
#only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.
